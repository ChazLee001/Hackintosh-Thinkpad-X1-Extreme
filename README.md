## Update
* [20181030] Might need to return this laptop back to Lenovo and get a new one. Mine showed some flaws.
* [20181030] Uploaded INSTALL4.0 and some BOOT post installations. iGPU weird with injected ioreg and fakeid on intelGFX.
* [20181028] Clover seemed to have DriverUEFI64 support FileVault2. I still don't recommended it, especially DURING INSTALL.
* [20181027] ~~DO NOT USE FILEVAULT!!! 100% DISK BREAK AFTER REBOOT GUARANTEED.~~ 
* [20181027] Officially starting this project because I bought a Thinkpad X1E. Thank you for support!
